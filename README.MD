In this directory I have implemented the smooth particle hydrodynamics algorithm following mathias muller paper. If you are interested in the details of implementation check dynamics.c. 


[TODO] Transcribe the equations from paper to this readme [\TODO]
The navier stokes equation which describes the motion of a viscous fluid can be put in the form:
$$\sum$$



Finally, this code is released under a MIT type license style.
