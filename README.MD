In this directory I have implemented the smooth particle hydrodynamics algorithm following mathias muller paper. If you are interested in the details of implementation check dynamics.c. [TODO] Transcribe the equations from paper to this readme [\TODO]
Finally, this code is released under a MIT type license style.
